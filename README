An emscripten port of giac for use with my own apps.  Most of this software is created by the giac creators, especially Bernard Parisse.  Some modifications have been added for my apps specific usage needs.  These modifications can be enabled/disabled using the BAC_OPTIONS compiler flag.

Note that asm.js backup copy is compiled with emscripten 1.34.1, while WASM version is compiled with 1.38 (latest)
